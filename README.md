## FAQ
> Why is this not part of the community plugins?

A: This cuts into their profits since they charge $10/month for sync

> What platforms does this work on?

All

> I can't find the .obsidian directory

It's hidden. You can configure your file app to show hidden files or use a terminal. For IOS, you might need to plug it into a computer, go to "Documents on iPhone", then `Obsidian/<your vault name>/.obsidian`. Then follow the installation instructions.

> Privacy?

The plugin is dead simple. No data collected. You can even run your sync server on the local network without access to the internet.
